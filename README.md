# Python with geoprocessing modules and PostgreSQL client

Includes Python 2 with GDAL, shapely, SciPy, RethinkDB, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL client and gosu in a docker image specifically for implementing DBSCAN clustering algorithm.

Added kombu because pika 0.11.2 does not implement socket timeout as per documentation.
